    <h1>Latest version of IOS</h1>
    <p class="p1">Apple announced iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 on June 22, 2020 at its annual WWDC 2020 event, with a developer beta released on the same day and a public beta released on July 9, 2020.[170] iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 were released on September 16, 2020. All devices
        that supported iOS 13 also support iOS 14. This makes the iPad Air 2 the first device to support seven versions of iOS and iPadOS, from iOS 8 to iPadOS 14. Some new features introduced in iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 include redesigned widgets that can
        now be placed directly on the homescreen, along with the App Library, which automatically categorizes apps into one page, Picture in Picture in iPhone and iPod touch, and the CarKey technology to unlock and start a car with NFC. iOS and iPadOS
        14 also allow the user to have incoming calls shown in banners rather than taking up the whole screen (the latter view is still available as an optional function).</p>
    <p class="p2">The release of iPadOS 14.0 brought support for the 8th generation iPad and the 4th generation iPad Air and the release of iOS 14.1 brought support for the iPhone 12, the iPhone 12 Mini and the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max. iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 have limited
        support on devices with A8, A8X, A9, A9X and A10 chips.</p>
